## Simple Calculator 
A simple calculator in C++ is a basic console-based application that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project helps beginners understand fundamental programming concepts such as user input, conditionals, and loops

### Key Concepts Covered

**User Input and Output:**

Use cin to get input from the user.
Use cout to display output to the user.

**Conditionals:**

Use if-else statements or a switch statement to perform different operations based on user input.

**Basic Arithmetic Operations**:

Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Loops (Optional):**

Allow the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.
